          To embark on a meaningful and inspiring search, I first clearly defined the tone and style I wanted for my
          website, opting for a minimalistic and modern approach.
          <br>
          <br>
          Then, I delved into finding inspiration. This involved creating a mood board for my website. Wondering what a
          mood board is? Essentially, it's a visual collage of favorite inspirations.
          <br>
          <br>
          So, I spent about an hour or two compiling my favorite website elements, sections, and designs from awards
          that truly resonated with me. I then consolidated them into my mood board, and here's the final result.

        </p>
        <p class="section-blog-text">
          Crafting a website's design hinges on a crucial step - the perfect color palette. For my minimalistic,
          contemporary vision, I carefully curated a monochromatic and neutral spectrum: deep charcoal black, pristine
          white, slate gray, and soft muted silver. This deliberate choice emanates simplicity, minimalism, and a sleek,
          modern vibe.
          <br>
          <br>
          To infuse my essence into the color scheme, I drew inspiration from my personal style. These handpicked colors
          now embody my identity and the desired ambiance flawlessly. With my palette curated, I delved into the realm
          of typefaces.

          Enter Plus Jakarta Sans - a bold, minimalistic font that commands attention for my headings and display text
          in pristine white. Its sleek lines exude modernity. Complementing this, Geist Mono, a sophisticated typeface,
          became the perfect match for body text in deep charcoal black. Its clean, elegant appearance ties the content
          together seamlessly. As a supplementary option for specific contexts, Georgia, with its timeless and classic
          appeal, offers an additional layer of versatility.

          Choosing my very first logo, something that will accompany me for the long haul, was quite the experience. I
          came across a striking collection of 267+ SVGs on Figma by 'JP' some time ago, and one design really resonated
          with me. I customized it by altering the colors and tweaking the shape just a bit to create my own logo.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm sharing this collection with you so you can explore it firsthand. Check it out <a

          WEBSITE DESIGN

        <p class="section-blog-text">
          Leveling up my portfolio was a turning point, but this time, I approached it with a fresh perspective. While
          keeping the essence intact, I revamped it from the ground up, repurposing select elements from the old
          portfolio into a sleek, reimagined design.
          <br>
          <br>
          My previous portfolio sported a vibrant design, laden with colors and gradients. However, the menu left me
          underwhelmed. Yet, I found solace in experimenting with blur effects—albeit more subtly compared to my
          previous website. I identified elements worth retaining, but truthfully, there weren't many that made the cut.
        </p>
        <img src="../../../img/writing/redesign-wr/portfolio-1.jpg" alt="Color palette picture" class="moodboard">
        <p class="section-blog-text">
          Before diving into the wireframing process, I brainstormed a list of must-haves for portfolios. Understanding
          that visitors don't have endless time to spare, I aimed to present myself swiftly and succinctly—a quick and
          straightforward glimpse into who I am and what I offer.
          <br>
          <br>
          Generally, people tend to shy away from extensive text on websites, preferring a more concise experience.
          However, if someone willingly clicks on content expecting substantial text (such as this post), it's a
          different story. Before laying out the primary sketch, I crafted a list which I've shared below. It might just
          come in handy for you too!
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Essential things and tips:</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Explore Figma to ignite your UX/UI creativity and craft something truly distinct for yourself. Curate a
          compelling color palette that resonates with your brand's identity. Prioritize responsiveness; in a
          mobile-dominated world, a non-responsive website loses its impact. Ensure seamless functionality across
          devices. Remember, your name, key skills, contact details (email), and a downloadable CV (PDF) are essentials
          that should always find a place in your portfolio and of course your work experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>
            Consider these optional additions that can enhance your portfolio: 
          </b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Consider incorporating a light and dark mode feature for your design if it aligns with your vision. Feel
          free to include personal hobbies, a blog section to share ideas and experiences, details about the
          technologies you're learning, and don't forget to emphasize showcasing your GitHub or LinkedIn profiles.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>
            Lastly, here are things I suggest avoiding or deem unnecessary to include in your portfolio:
          </b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Avoid integrating unrelated social networks into your portfolio. For instance, if your Twitter isn’t professionally aligned, skip adding it. Steer clear of excessive text unless it's for a blog; the main objective is to summarize information on your page. Exclude irrelevant details that don't contribute to your professional profile.
          <br>
          <hr class="divide-blog">
          <p class="section-blog-text">
            Now that you've sorted out the essential information, it's time to assemble the blueprint of your portfolio. How do you begin? My suggestion is to head to Figma, create a blank frame, and start arranging boxes within it. Label these boxes with the names of the information you wish to include.
            <img src="../../../img/writing/redesign-wr/wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe" class="moodboard">
            <br>
            <br>
            This initial sketch defined the layout where I envisioned everything. My recommendation is to begin by determining the layout, then substitute the boxes with text, incorporate images if you have, and simultaneously create a similar sketch tailored for mobile view.
            <br>
            <br>
            After finalizing these elements, this is where I recommend applying the defined color palettes and integrating your chosen fonts into the design.
            <img src="../../../img/writing/redesign-wr/wireframe-1.png" alt="" class="moodboard">
            <br>
            <br>
            For my project, I replicated the same layout but with a white theme. Simply invert the colors to achieve this variation.

          Now, transitioning to the development phase, I opted for simplicity, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the development process.

          Creating the portfolio during the development phase was relatively smooth. It took me just three days to finalize and complete my website entirely.
